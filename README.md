# Genetic neural networks
The last library for reinforcement learning you'll ever need


### Basic concepts

- Neural networks which can be edited (a.k.a. mutated) in several ways
- Genetic algorithm that exposes all the key steps to your AI
- Everything happens asynchronously, so that you can do the evaluations in any env
